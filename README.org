* Testing github's org support

#+begin_src ruby
  def hello
    puts "hello"
  end
#+end_src

** Some more

This should be in *bold* and this in /italic/.

* Another try

And this should be source code:

```ruby
class Foo
  attr_accessor :name
end
```

And a link to one of our projects: [[https://github.com/bbcrd/radiotag-models][radiotag-models]].
